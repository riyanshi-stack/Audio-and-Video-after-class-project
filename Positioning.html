        <h1>My Favrourite Fruit</h1>
        <p>A mango is a juicy, sweet, and delicious tropical fruit that grows on tall trees!. When ripe, they are usually yellow or
        orange with a smooth skin, and inside, you'll find soft, golden flesh with a big seed in the middle. Mangoes are packed
        with vitamins, making them a healthy snack, and many people call them the "king of fruits" because they taste so good!
        You can eat them fresh, make mango juice, or even use them in yummy desserts.</p>
