        <p>The internet is the most recent man-made creation that connects the world. The world has narrowed down after the
        invention of the internet. It has demolished all boundaries, which were the barriers between people and has made
        everything accessible. The internet is helpful to us in different ways. It is beneficial for sharing information with
        people in any corner of the world. It is also used in schools, government and private offices, and other public spaces.
        We stay connected to our close ones and share all the recent and live news with the help of the internet. Sitting in our
        homes, we know about all that's happening around the world with a click or a swipe. The internet gives an answer to
        almost every question and touches every aspect of our lives.</p>
