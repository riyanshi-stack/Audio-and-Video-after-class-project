            <p><mark>Drawing by itself is an art that gives peace and pleasure. Furthermore, learning the art of drawing can lead to
            efficiency in other mediums. Also, having an accurate drawing is the basis of a realistic painting.</mark>
            
            Drawing has the power to make people more expressive. It is well known that the expression of some people can't always
            take place by the use of words and actions only. Therefore, drawing can serve as an important form of communication for
            people.
            
            It is possible to gain insight into the thoughts and feelings of people through their drawings. Moreover, this can
            happen by examining the colour <mark>pattern</mark>, <mark>design</mark>, <mark>style</mark>, and <mark>theme</mark> of the drawing. One good advantage of being able to
            express through drawing is the boosting of one's emotional intelligence.</p>
